 *
 *   1. Pre-fetches the user's username (creates the prompt context the

 *   2. Calls the chat backend with the system prompt + conversation + tool defs.
 *   3. Dispatches each tool call locally, appending the result.
 *   4. Loops until the model returns a plain `assistant` message.
 *
 * Side effects (transfers, swaps, bridge handoffs) are gated behind
 * `requireConfirm`, never auto-executed.
